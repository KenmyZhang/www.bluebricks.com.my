										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A common question you’ll be asked when buying a house, renting an apartment or applying for a bank loan is: Can you provide <strong>proof of income</strong>?</p>



<p>Providing proof of income is expected for those wanting to secure a loan or sign a lease. Knowing what these documents are can be helpful if you were asked to provide one.</p>



<p>In this article, we explain what is proof of income and outline what documents can serve as proof of income in Malaysia.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>What Is Proof of Income?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="571" src="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-08-002809-1024x571.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4978" srcset="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-08-002809-1024x571.jpg 1024w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-08-002809-300x167.jpg 300w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-08-002809-768x429.jpg 768w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-08-002809.jpg 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Let’s start with the basics. Proof of income is an official document that summarises your earnings over a specific period (usually a year). These documents prove that you are earning the amount you claim.</p>



<p>Generally, this documentation is required by landlords, banks, insurance providers, and credit card companies to determine your ability to make payments over a period of time.</p>



<p>Examples of situations where you would need your proof of income include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Submitting tax returns</li>



<li>Purchasing health insurance</li>



<li>Obtaining a credit card or mortgage</li>



<li>Renting an apartment or a house</li>



<li>Getting a car loan, personal loan etc.</li>
</ul>

<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Banks &amp; Proof of Income</strong></h2>



<p>When <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/refinancing-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refinancing your loan</a>, you are required to provide your <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/income-documents-malaysia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">income documents</a> to your lender. These documents serve as proof of your personal and financial information.</p>



<p>The bank or lender you are applying for your loan from will review them to verify if you are earning enough income to settle your loan.</p>



<p>However, do take note that while each lender has its own unique application and eligibility requirements, many of them will ask for similar proof of income.</p>



<p>Therefore, by familiarising yourself with the types of income documents you may need to submit, you can prepare yourself for the application process and increase your chances of approval.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Proof of Income Required For a Bank Loan in Malaysia</strong></h2>



<p>There are many different types of employment in Malaysia. From full-time and part-time contracts to casual (freelance) jobs, fixed term, internships and more.</p>



<p>Moreover, each type of employment has its own wages and income documents. Therefore, it is essential to know the correct type of income documents you should submit when applying for any type of loan.</p>

<p>It is important to note that contract employees, such as freelancers, gig workers and part-timers, can have their loan applications rejected. This is because banks and financial institutions may assume that they are unable to repay their loan.</p>



<p>However, this issue can be resolved by providing the necessary financial documents, such as income tax documents or other proof of income. If you need any help preparing your income documents, our <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consultants at Bluebricks can help</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Challenges in Verifying Proof of Income</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dada-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4980" srcset="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dada-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dada-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dada-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dada.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>While the income verification process may seem straightforward, some challenges may arise during the application process. Three common income verification challenges include:</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>1. Providing Inaccurate Income Information</strong></h4>



<p>When applying for a <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/house-loans-malaysia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">housing loan</a>, <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/credit-card-debt-malaysia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit card</a>, or property lease, applicants may accidentally include the wrong income, prolonging the lending process. Therefore applicants must always carefully review the information they have provided.</p>



<p>Moreover, there are some instances where an applicant intentionally makes their earnings appear higher than they are. This is because they want to make it seem as if they have the finances to manage ongoing payments.</p>



<p>However, applicants are advised never to put false information in their application documents, as this is against the law.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>2. Submitting the Wrong Income Verification Documents</strong></h4>



<p>As there is a variety of proof of income documents available, it’s easy for many loan applicants to submit the wrong income document when applying for a service, a loan, or a rental.</p>



<p>While providing the wrong documents can be an accidental oversight, it can slow down the lending process.</p>



<p>The applicant will have to take more time to prepare their new income documents, and banks and other lenders will have to pay additional attention when conducting verifications.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>3. You Do Not Meet The Required Income Threshold</strong></h4>



<p>Sometimes, you will not meet the income threshold when applying for a loan or a rental property. If this happens, you’ll likely need a co-signer on your application, or you can reapply once your financial situation improves.</p>



<p>If you do not have the time or are unsure if the documents you have prepared are correct, we recommend consulting an expert who can help you review your income documents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Unless you have applied for a mortgage before, you can easily be overwhelmed by the many types of <strong>mortgage professionals</strong> available. For example, common terms you would encounter in your home-buying research include mortgage loan officer, <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/outsource-banker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outsource banker</a> and rejected mortgage loan specialists.</p>



<p>At first glance, they may seem similar, but each of them has distinct roles. Therefore, it is essential to understand the different types of mortgage professionals so that you can select the one that can help you apply for a mortgage.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll go over what are mortgage loan officers, outsource bankers and rejected mortgage loan specialists. Plus, we’ll outline their advantages and disadvantages so that you can understand how each one can help you secure <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/house-loans-malaysia/">financing for a</a><a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/house-loans-malaysia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/house-loans-malaysia/">home</a>.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Mortgage Loan Officers</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/hands-agent-client-shaking-hands-after-signed-contract-buy-new-apartment-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4968" srcset="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/hands-agent-client-shaking-hands-after-signed-contract-buy-new-apartment-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/hands-agent-client-shaking-hands-after-signed-contract-buy-new-apartment-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/hands-agent-client-shaking-hands-after-signed-contract-buy-new-apartment-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/hands-agent-client-shaking-hands-after-signed-contract-buy-new-apartment-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/hands-agent-client-shaking-hands-after-signed-contract-buy-new-apartment-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>A mortgage loan officer is a licensed official of a credit union, bank or financial institution who helps borrowers in the mortgage application process.</p>



<p>Mortgage loan officers must be highly well-versed with many different types of lending products, as they work with a variety of consumers and small business owners.</p>



<p>Moreover, they have a comprehensive knowledge of the banking industry&#8217;s rules and regulations and the required documentation to obtain a loan. This is because they will only approve the customer&#8217;s loan application if it meets the bank&#8217;s standards.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>What Do Mortgage Loan Officers Do?</strong></h2>



<p>The primary responsibility of the mortgage loan officer is to act as an advisor for the borrower. However, a mortgage loan officer&#8217;s job description varies from lender to lender.</p>



<p>Other responsibilities of mortgage loan officers include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Checking the information on your loan application</li>



<li>Collecting documents to support your loan request</li>



<li>Helping you negotiate the best mortgage terms based on your finances</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Working With A Mortgage Loan Officer</strong></h2>



<p>The main benefit of working with a mortgage loan officer is that they help their clients with their loan application process and are familiar with the loans offered by their financial institutions. Moreover, you will not have to pay for their services.</p>



<p>Unlike mortgage brokers, a mortgage loan officer does not compare financial options between institutions. Instead, they focus on helping borrowers find a loan product from their bank or financial institution that they qualify for and can afford.</p>



<p>They also know the banking industry&#8217;s rules and how these rules will be applied to each loan application. However, as loan officers serve a particular institution, they can only offer available loans and mortgage rates of that financial institution.</p>

<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Outsource Bankers</strong></h2>



<p>Outsource bankers are third-party mortgage or loan processors responsible for preparing and processing your <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/housing-loan-document-malaysia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loan application documents</a> before it gets approved by the loan underwriter.</p>



<p>They play an important role in getting your mortgage loan request to the final close. However, unlike a mortgage loan officer, an outsource banker is not employed by a bank or financial institution.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>What Does An Outsource Banker Do?</strong></h2>



<p>An outsource banker offers services similar to the previously mentioned mortgage professionals. They guide the borrower through the loan application process and will set up the borrower with the proper documents for the loan programme they want to use.</p>



<p>Below are several other responsibilities an outsource banker has:</p>



<ul>
<li>Collecting, verifying, and following up on supporting documents</li>



<li>Analysing your <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/ccris-report-credit-score/">credit re</a><a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/ccris-report-credit-score/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">port</a></li>



<li>Working with the loan underwriter</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Benefits of Working With An Outsource Banker</strong></h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>1. Access To Industry Experts</strong></h4>



<p>One of the benefits of working with an outsource banker is that you can access diverse experts across the mortgage industry.</p>



<p>An outsource banker can contact loan officers from various banks to discover which banks will or will not approve their client&#8217;s loan application documents.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>2. State-Of-The-Art Technologies And Tools</strong></h4>



<p>An outsource banker has access to effective automation technologies in the market, from artificial intelligence to chatbots.</p>



<p>By working with an outsource banker, you can leave it to them to improve your loan processing quality, time, and costs with their advanced technologies and tools.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>3. Meet Regulatory Compliance</strong></h4>



<p>You can also benefit from guaranteed compliance if you leave your loan to outsource bankers. This is because they have the resources to manage compliance requirements without running into any obstacles in the process.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Drawbacks of Working With An Outsource Banker</strong></h2>



<p>Similar to the other two mortgage professionals in this article, you will have to pay a outsource banker for their services once your loan application is approved.</p>



<p>It’s also important to understand that they come with risks as well. For example, with an outsource banker, you may experience the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Confidentiality and security issues as your data may be at risk due to the lack of control you have over your systems</li>



<li>Lack of flexibility as the contract could be too rigid to accommodate change</li>



<li>Instability as the outsourcing company could go out of business</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Rejected Mortgage Loan Specialists</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/da-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4972" srcset="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/da-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/da-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/da-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/da.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>A rejected mortgage loan specialist acts as an intermediary between someone who wants to buy real estate and those offering loans to do so. They do the same job as the two mortgage professionals listed above, except that they are independent of a bank or financial institution and have knowledge of mortgages offered by a variety of lenders.</p>



<p>Moreover, a rejected mortgage loan specialist is connected with many different lending institutions and understands the financial services they all offer in order to find the best loan for each borrower.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>What is the Role of a Rejected Mortgage Loan Specialist?</strong></h2>



<p>Working with a rejected mortgage loan specialist can save you time, effort, and money. Their responsibilities include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Negotiating with banks and credit lenders to find the best loan solution for their clients</li>



<li>Assisting with documentation</li>



<li>Overseeing the financing process</li>



<li>Ensuring compliance with banking and financial legislation</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Benefits of Working With A Rejected Mortgage Loan Specialist</strong></h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>1. Access To A Broad Range Of Mortgage Loans</strong></h4>



<p>A rejected mortgage loan specialist offers a wide range of mortgage loans from many different lenders. The wider their network, the better your chances of obtaining the loan and interest rate that best suits your needs.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>2. Finds You The Most Advantageous Deal</strong></h4>



<p>A rejected mortgage loan specialist represents your interests rather than the interests of a lender. They act not only as your representative but as a knowledgeable consultant and problem solver.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>3. <strong>Customised Service</strong></h4>



<p>Customised service is the differentiating factor when working with a rejected mortgage loan specialist. They should help smooth the way, be available to you, and advise you throughout the closing process.</p>



<p>Hiring a competent rejected mortgage loan specialist can help you find the right mortgage you&#8217;re eligible for and best suit your affordability.</p>



<p>If your loan application was rejected, Bluebricks offers professional services, such as improving your <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/ctos-score/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit score</a> and <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/dsr-calculator-malaysia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debt service ratio (DSR)</a> and preparing the necessary <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/income-documents-malaysia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">income documents</a> to help you get your loan approved.</p>



<p>Or, if you are in urgent need of funds, we offer a 30-day fast loan with no hidden costs as well.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>The Drawback of Working With A Rejected Mortgage Loan Specialist</strong></h2>



<p>When choosing a mortgage professional to work with, it is essential to know that a rejected mortgage loan specialist&#8217;s fees are considerably higher in comparison to an outsource banker&#8217;s.</p>



<p>However, they have a higher approval rate, with proven strategies that can streamline their clients&#8217; loan application process.</p>



<p>Add your rejected mortgage loan specialist&#8217;s fees to your estimated mortgage costs to decide how good a deal you are getting. Moreover, be sure to settle all fee issues upfront before you begin working with a loan specialist or sign anything.</p>

<h2><strong>3 Reasons Why You Should Consult A Mortgage Broker</strong></h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>1. Mortgage Brokers Are Unbiased</strong></h4>



<p>Mortgage brokers work for the interest of their clients and not for banks. They will compare many lenders to find you a mortgage with great rates, lower fees, or other benefits that suits your needs.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>2. Mortgage Brokers Have A Vast Network Of Lenders</strong></h4>



<p>Due to their experience and contacts, a mortgage broker will usually have access to a wide range of lenders, such as banks, credit units, private lenders and more. This means they may have a better chance of finding a deal that fits your criteria.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>3. Mortgage Brokers Have The Flexibility To Meet Your Needs</strong></h4>



<p>A mortgage broker has the expertise and resources to solve their clients&#8217; problems.</p>



<p>For example, if a borrower has credit issues, the broker will know which lenders offer the best and most affordable financial products that meet their needs.</p>



<p>Borrowers who need larger loans will also benefit from a broker’s knowledge and ability to obtain financing successfully.</p>

<p>Hiring an experienced and competent mortgage broker in Malaysia can help you find the right mortgage that you’re most eligible for and best suits your affordability. They will even sort out your loan application for you, leaving you with fewer worries about your loan getting rejected!</p>



<p>Here are 4 questions you can ask yourself when choosing a mortgage broker to work with:</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>1. Do I Need Help Applying For A Specific Type Of Loan?</strong></h4>



<p>When choosing a mortgage broker, it&#8217;s essential to think about the type of loan you are looking for. This way, you can select a broker who has experience obtaining your preferred type of loan and will know how to help you.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>2. Is The Mortgage Broker Trustworthy?</strong></h4>



<p>In Malaysia, a mortgage broker does not necessarily need to obtain a license to process a mortgage loan application. This is because the mortgage brokerage industry is still new to Malaysia and is, therefore, not regulated by any law.</p>



<p>However, housing loan submissions are still subject to a bank&#8217;s internal review process and fraud policies. If you experience any problems with your mortgage broker in Malaysia, you can lodge a police report to take civil action.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>3. What Is It Like Working With The Mortgage Broker?</strong></h4>



<p>Applying for a mortgage is a challenging and time-consuming process. It is recommended to work with a broker you&#8217;re comfortable with, one you know will help you understand the terms of the loan.</p>



<p>Think about how you would want to communicate with your mortgage broker. Here are some factors you can consider:</p>



<ul>
<li>Do you want them to contact you regularly?</li>



<li>Do you want them to be available after hours to answer your questions?</li>



<li>Do you prefer to be contacted through texts or calls?</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>4. How Available Is The Mortgage Broker?</strong></h4>



<p>If you urgently need to buy a home or refinance one, you would want a mortgage broker who can keep up with your needs.</p>



<p>Ask your mortgage broker how many clients they typically work with at one time and when they will be available to help you look for loans.</p>



<p>If they are very busy, they might not be able to provide you with the attention you need to help you buy immediately.</p>



<p>However, if you do not need to buy right away, you can take your time finding someone who matches your personality. Then, you can start the home-buying process with your mortgage broker in earnest when they are available. </p>

<p>Have you ever wondered what a <strong>loan drawdown</strong> is? While it may seem like a small detail, a loan drawdown can be an essential aspect of loan agreements.</p>



<p>By receiving the loan amount at different times throughout the term of the loan agreement, borrowers can take out what they need when they need it.</p>



<p>It helps them manage their cash flow and meet obligations such as interest payments or taxes so that they can avoid getting into <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/pay-off-debt/">debt</a>.</p>



<p>Discover the steps involved in the loan drawdown process, from loan acceptance to a successful loan drawdown.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>What Is Loan Drawdown in Malaysia?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/213-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4932" srcset="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/213-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/213-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/213-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/213.jpg 1198w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In simple terms, a loan drawdown is the release of funds under an agreement with a lender. Lenders often allow loan drawdowns to give money advances to borrowers and set interest rates based on these short borrowing periods.</p>



<p>The loan drawdown happens after both parties have agreed to a loan. The lender will process the requested funds and deposit them in the borrower&#8217;s bank account.</p>



<p>The borrower will then have to pay off the loan amount in increments, usually with interest, until the drawdown amount and other term agreements are satisfied.</p>



<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/house-loans-malaysia/">home loans</a>, a loan drawdown means you are using the money the lender provided to buy the property. Lenders use this term to describe when the money is usually paid directly into the bank account of your choice, usually on the settlement day of the property.</p>



<p>For example, you recently bought your first home for RM700,000. After paying your RM140,000 deposit and receiving the final contract, you have five weeks until your settlement date.</p>



<p>You then carry out the necessary steps before your loan drawdown, such as preparing your documents and participating in a property valuation.</p>



<p>Upon the official settlement date, your lender will draw down the remaining RM560,000 to pay the vendor. You are now the official homeowner of the new property.</p>



<p>On the other hand, money is separated into multiple payments if a property is under construction. This is because the construction project is completed in different stages.</p>



<p>For example, you were approved for an RM300,000 construction loan but have only drawn down RM20,000 so far; therefore, you’ll only be charged interest for the $20,000.</p>



<p>However, if you draw RM30,000 in the next phase of the construction, you’ll be charged interest on RM50,000. It continues that way until the entire loan has been used.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Understanding the Loan Drawdown Process</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/23131-1024x683.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4934" srcset="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/23131-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/23131-300x200.png 300w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/23131-768x512.png 768w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/23131.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>A loan drawdown is an important step in the loan application process. It is important that you understand the entire process to know the steps involved in a successful loan application.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>1. Loan Acceptance</strong></h4>



<p>In the loan application process, once your bank approves your loan, they will send you a loan approval lett. Read it carefully, as it will outline everything you need to do.</p>



<p>Once you are satisfied with the loan details and have signed the loan acceptance letter, the bank will assign a solicitor to begin the facility agreement.</p>



<p>You will then have to sign the Facility Agreement and other relevant loan documents at your appointed solicitor’s office.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>2. Legal Documentation</strong></h4>



<p>In this stage, your appointed solicitor will commence the necessary legal work, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Conducting a land and bankruptcy search</li>



<li>Applying for a private caveat, a formal legal notice to the public that you have an interest in a particular property or land</li>



<li>Applying for consent to charge from State Authority (if applicable)</li>



<li>Obtaining the redemption statement from the existing financier (for refinancing cases)</li>



<li>Presenting the Memorandum of Transfer (MOT) to State Authority for release of the balance loan sum for sub-sale cases.</li>



<li>Stamping of <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/housing-loan-document-malaysia/">housing loan documents</a></li>
</ul>



<p>In the meantime, you will have to ensure that your quit rent and assessment and maintenance fees (for Strata properties) are duly paid, and a copy of the receipt is sent to the loan solicitor.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>3. Property Valuation</strong></h4>



<p>Once your documents are in order, your bank will appoint a <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/property-valuer-malaysia/">panel valuation firm</a> to inspect the said property. Your appointed valuer will contact you and make an appointment to <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/property-valuation-malaysia/">visit your property</a>.</p>



<p>A full inspection will be conducted, and internal and external photographs of the property will be taken as proof of inspection.</p>



<p>The valuation report will then be prepared and sent to your bank within 2 to 4 weeks from the inspection date.</p>

<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>4. Loan Drawdown</strong></h4>



<p>Your bank will disburse your loan within 1 to 2 weeks from the date of receipt of the solicitor&#8217;s Letter of Advice for drawdown and the valuation report (subject to full compliance with the bank&#8217;s Letter of Approval and terms and conditions).</p>



<p>The loan drawdown timeline varies according to the type of property. The initial drawdown is to pay the redemption sum to your existing financier (for refinancing properties) or vendor&#8217;s financier (for sub-sale properties).</p>



<p>However, for properties under construction, the loan will be drawdown upon receipt of progressive billing from the developer.</p>



<p>The balance drawdown will commence upon receipt of the original security documents.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>5. Loan Advices</strong></h4>



<p>You will receive an update on your loan within 1 month from the date of the loan drawdown.</p>



<p>For properties under construction, you and your financier will receive progressive billings.</p>



<p>On the other hand, for instalment-based loans, you will receive advice on the commencement of instalment.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>6. Loan Statement</strong></h4>



<p>You will receive your loan statement from your lender in:</p>



<ul>
<li>Yearly statements (for conventional home loans and Islamic financing packages)</li>



<li>Monthly statements (for Flexi home loans and mortgages and Flexi financing-i packages)</li>
</ul>

<p>Most people dream of owning a home in the future, but the process, from loan application to <strong>loan disbursement</strong>, can seem complicated at first.</p>



<p>In this article, we look into various formalities involved in the loan disbursal process and various other factors that can delay a loan disbursement.</p>



<p>But before we get into the loan disbursement process in Malaysia, we must first understand the various property titles in Malaysia.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Important Property Titles in Malaysia You Need to Know</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rwr-1024x683.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4924" srcset="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rwr-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rwr-300x200.png 300w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rwr-768x512.png 768w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rwr.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4><strong>1. Individual Title</strong></h4>



<p>An individual title is a property title issued when you are the sole owner of an entire piece of land. This is given to homeowners of landed properties such as semi-D houses, terrace houses, and bungalows.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>2. Strata Title</strong></h4>



<p>A strata title is a property title often issued for high-rise properties such as condominiums and apartments.</p>



<p>The land owner with a strata title will have to share the common facilities and areas of the property with other residents, for example, the swimming pool, gym, elevators, lounge and more.</p>



<p>The strata title is essential for homeowners because it serves as proof of ownership of the apartment or condominium and can prevent complications should the developer come under liquidation or become bankrupt.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>3. Master Title</strong></h4>



<p>During a property&#8217;s construction and development stage, the entire project or land is put under the master title. It is usually registered under the name of the proprietor or developer.</p>



<p>Once the construction and development stage is completed, its separate units will be divided and sold into individual titles or strata titles.</p>



<p>However, the common areas and shared facilities, such as playgrounds, swimming pools and outdoor spaces, will remain under the master title.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>4. Freehold Property</strong></h4>



<p>In Malaysia, when the State Authority disposes of land to an individual for an infinite period, it will be considered a freehold title.</p>



<p>The buyer will own the land the property is built on and have the freedom to do what they want with the land.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>5. Leasehold Property</strong></h4>



<p>On the contrary, when the State Authority disposes of a piece of land to an individual for a period of time (not exceeding 999 years), the land will be considered a leasehold title.</p>



<p>Once the leasehold period expires, the land returns to the State Authority. If the owner wants to retain the land, they will have to apply for a leasehold extension before the lease expires.</p>



<p>Unlike properties with a freehold title, leasehold title owners must abide by stricter rules and regulations.</p>

<h2><strong>Understanding the Loan Disbursement for Different Properties in Malaysia</strong></h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>1. For Individual &amp; Strata Title Properties</strong></h4>



<p>For individual and strata property owners who want to refinance their loan, the time needed to refinance their loan will be different.</p>



<p>On the other hand, for landowners with a freehold property, the loan disbursement process will take approximately 3 months. However, for leasehold property owners, it may take up to 6 months because they need to receive consent from the State the property is in.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>2. For Master Title Properties</strong></h4>



<p>In Malaysia, there are two common issues regarding strata titles:</p>



<ul>
<li>Developers have not applied for strata titles or</li>



<li>Strata title has been issued, but the buyer has not obtained it.</li>
</ul>



<p>Suppose a property is not given its strata title or the developed does not complete the title transfer process. In that case, the land still legally belongs to the developer (or the registered proprietor).</p>



<p>This can become problematic as the homeowner may face difficulties with the loan disbursement process.</p>



<p>Banks require more cost and time to provide financing for Master title properties of more than 10 years (an additional 3 months) or a property with a bankrupt developer (1-year process).</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>What is Property Encumbrance?</strong></h2>



<p>A property encumbrance is an interest or right held by a third party that hinders a transaction, such as a real estate transfer.</p>



<p>For example, you have a mortgage with the bank. If you have not paid it off, your property’s deed will not be released by the bank.</p>



<p>Instead, the lender retains an interest on your property until the mortgage is paid in full. But if the mortgage is not repaid, the lender may foreclose, seizing your home as collateral and evicting its inhabitants.</p>



<p>Therefore, knowing if your property is free from encumbrance is essential as it impacts its transferability. If the property is free of encumbrances, <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/refinancing-housing-loan/">refinancing</a> can be carried out.</p>



<p>But take note, the title transfer process from your &#8216;old&#8217; bank to the new one will require an additional month.</p>

<h2><strong>4 Other Common Factors That Can Delay a Loan Disbursement</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/r2r2-1024x683.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4927" srcset="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/r2r2-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/r2r2-300x200.png 300w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/r2r2-768x512.png 768w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/r2r2.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>1. Bank Operations Vary</strong></h4>



<p>The loan disbursement process varies from bank to bank. For example, different banks require different documents and may have different loan policies or applicant screening processes in place.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>2. The Law Firm You Work With</strong></h4>



<p>The law firm you work with can impact your loan disbursement process. When looking for legal representation to work with, you should consider the following:</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>3. Experience &amp; Track Record</strong></h4>



<p>Do the lawyers have experience? You need to find attorneys who specialise in the legal service you need. Such a lawyer will know all the factors that may affect your case ahead of time.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>4. Ratings</strong></h4>



<p>Another effective way to evaluate potential attorneys is to look at the ratings and reviews given by their clients and peers in the legal community.</p>



<p>Ask if the firm can provide the names of past clients you can contact as references.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>5. Size</strong></h4>



<p>When choosing a law firm, bigger isn&#8217;t always better. Many larger firms need to run through numerous cases at a time, and therefore, the unique aspects of each client&#8217;s case can get lost in the process.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>6. Connections</strong></h4>



<p>An experienced law firm often partners with other law firms when it&#8217;s in the client&#8217;s best interest, particularly in complex, high-value cases.</p>



<p>For example, sometimes attorneys join forces to share their research, expertise, and other resources to build the best case for you.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>7. Missing Loan Documents</strong></h4>



<p>The loan application process requires many documents to be filled out, and keeping track of all your <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/housing-loan-document-malaysia/">documents</a> can be difficult.</p>



<p>Small errors such as a misspelt last name or using a nickname instead of a legal name can delay the loan disbursement process.</p>



<p>Misplaced documents can also delay the process, as the buyer must prepare another copy.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>8. Land Office Operations</strong></h4>



<p>A land office, also known as the Land Registry in Malaysia, receives all applications to register a newly purchased or transferred property.</p>



<p>Land titles must be registered with the Land Registry to conclude the ownership transfer process and allow the new owner to have complete property ownership and rights.</p>



<p>The property registration process in Malaysia is carried out in 4 steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Submission of the sale and purchase agreement at the Stamp Office</li>



<li><a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/property-valuation-malaysia/">Property valuation</a></li>



<li>Registration of the property with the Land Registry</li>



<li>Transfer of property</li>
</ul>



<p>However, the transfer process is different according to the type of property. Freehold properties have a faster transfer process as the owner does not need to receive consent from the State.</p>



<p>However, for leasehold properties, the owner will need to wait approximately 3 months to obtain the State Authority’s consent. The information provided by the seller also determines the time required to obtain consent.</p>

<p>If you’re like most people, you would only ever think about your <strong>credit score in Malaysia</strong> when you want to buy health insurance, get a <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/personal-loan-malaysia/">personal</a> or property loan, or even rent an apartment.</p>



<p>However, your credit score is what stands between you and the bank’s decision to approve the loan or credit card you are applying for.</p>



<p>Having good credit is advantageous in many ways. It can help you get approved for attractive rates and terms when you apply for a loan, whereas having bad credit may cost you money in ways you may not expect.</p>



<p>Read on and we’ll tell you what you need to know about your credit score in Malaysia and how you can improve it!</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>What Is A Credit Score?</strong></h2>



<p>A credit score in Malaysia is a number given to represent your trustworthiness as a borrower. It helps a bank or lender determine whether to accept your loan application, the amount they’re willing to lend you, and the terms and interest rates they will offer.</p>



<p>Your credit report can also say a lot about your financial history. It includes your credit activity, such as loan paying history, and your current credit situation.</p>



<p>Insurance providers, landlords and banks use your credit report to verify your overall trustworthiness as a borrower as well as your repayment behaviour.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>4 Ways to Improve Your Credit Score in Malaysia</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wefegf-1024x683.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4915" srcset="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wefegf-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wefegf-300x200.png 300w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wefegf-768x512.png 768w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wefegf.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Your credit score is important. When you have a higher credit score, you are more likely to be approved for new loans or lines of credit and receive lower interest rates when you borrow.</p>



<p>Here are several tips to improve your credit score in Malaysia:</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>1. Limit Your Requests For New Credit</strong></h4>



<p>When you apply for a new credit account, the lender will carry out a hard enquiry on your credit score to determine how much risk you pose as a borrower.</p>



<p>However, too many hard inquiries on your credit report within a short period can damage your credit score.</p>



<p>Banks and lenders would assume that you are in need of money because you’re facing financial difficulties and are, therefore, a bigger risk. Hence, if you are trying to raise your credit score, avoid applying for new credit for a while.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>2. Make Regular Payments On Time</strong></h4>



<p>Make payments on time, on or before the due date. It is a good way to show lenders you’re a reliable borrower and capable of handling credit responsibly.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>3. Check For Errors In Your Credit Report</strong></h4>



<p>Small mistakes, such as a mistyped address, can affect your score and be enough for a lender to reject your loan application. You should check your credit report carefully to ensure all the information on it is accurate and up to date.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>4. Keep Your Credit Utilisation Low</strong></h4>



<p>Your credit utilisation is the percentage of your credit limit you have used. For example, if your credit limit is RM2,000 and you’ve used RM1,000 of that, your credit utilisation is 50%.</p>



<p>Generally, a lower percentage is seen positively by lenders. It is recommended to try and keep your credit utilisation below 30% to improve your chances of getting your loan application approved.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>How Often Should You Check Your Credit Score?</strong></h2>



<p>Establishing a good credit score is essential for your overall financial picture. With a good credit score, it is easier for your credit cards, <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/house-loans-malaysia/">loans</a>, mortgages, and more to be approved.</p>



<p>Moreover, a good credit score can be especially helpful when facing an <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/medical-fees-debt-refinance/">unexpected financial crisis</a>, such as a layoff. Banks will see you as a responsible borrower and may increase the loan amount you can apply for.</p>



<p>We suggest you check your credit score and report at least once a year – and sometimes more often – to spot errors or fraud and to get a sense of your credit health.</p>



<p>The information they contain can help you make wiser decisions that will help you save money and build a stronger financial foundation.</p>

<h2><strong>Credit Score in Malaysia &#8211; FAQs</strong></h2>



<p>Building credit can be essential for many things. That is because lenders and other companies often use your credit information to decide whether you qualify for things like <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/house-loans-malaysia/">housing loans</a> and credit cards.</p>



<p>A bad credit score can be fixed, but having no score is also bad because lenders cannot profile you and decide if you are able to pay back your loans. Even if you do not need it now, building a credit history could be helpful for future loan applications.</p>



<p>If you want to learn more, here are some commonly asked questions about credit scores in Malaysia.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<p>Whether you are in the process of selling or purchasing a home or acquiring a <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/house-loans-malaysia/">home loan</a>, there are multiple reasons to conduct a <strong>property valuation in Malaysia</strong>.</p>



<p>A property valuation is an assessment of your property&#8217;s value based on its location, condition and multiple other factors. It is an essential process for existing homeowners and potential homebuyers.</p>



<p>For existing homeowners, conducting a property valuation helps them know how much their property is currently worth. For example, homeowners who have lived in the same property for decades or have renovated their homes would want to know if there was an increase in their property&#8217;s value.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, for potential homebuyers looking to apply for a mortgage loan, a property valuation is key to determining the loan amount granted by financial institutions.</p>



<p>If you find it difficult to determine the market value of your property, read through our comprehensive guide to learn more about property valuation in Malaysia.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>3 Reasons A Bank Would Reject Your Loan</strong></h2>



<p>Various factors can result in a home loan application being rejected – from <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/credit-card-debt-malaysia/">bad credit scores</a> due to default or late payments from other credit facilities to a low <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/dsr-calculator-malaysia/">debt service ratio</a> (DSR).</p>



<p>However, even if you have a high income and <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/ccris-report-credit-score/">credit score</a>, you may still be rejected by banks due to the following factors:</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>1. The Type Of Land</strong></h4>



<p>It may be challenging to secure financing from banks for leasehold (with less than 60 years left) and Malay reserved properties. This is because these lands are difficult to resell in an auction due to their restrictions.</p>



<p>Depending on the bank, properties with a remaining lease period of less than 30 years will not be financed. Banks consider leasehold properties as high-risk financing, as the property value will drop towards the end of the lease.</p>



<p>As for Malay reserved land, it will be difficult for the banks to auction it, as only Malay buyers are eligible to purchase the land.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>2. The Property&#8217;s Location</strong></h4>



<p>You may be unable to get a loan for properties in certain areas for various reasons.</p>



<p>For example, areas with a slow appreciation rate due to a history of landslides or flooding are unlikely to receive financing from banks.</p>



<p>Moreover, some residential neighbourhoods or areas may not fulfil the bank’s approval criteria. This is due to their low marketability and occupancy or increasing trend of auctions.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>3. Property Maintenance</strong></h4>



<p>Banks are not willing to approve a loan for old properties (more than 10 years), especially if it is poorly managed and maintained. For example, leaks or flooding caused by poor plumbing infrastructure.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>4. Old Properties with a Master Title</strong></h4>



<p>There are many banks and financial institutions that are reluctant to approve loans for properties without strata or individual titles issued.</p>



<p>This is because properties with a master title of more than 10 years are usually related to inefficient or bankrupt developers. Therefore, it is best to check on the status of the developer when deciding on a property.</p>

<h2><strong>What Is A Property Valuation Report in Malaysia?</strong></h2>



<p>During the home-buying process, a property valuation report is a written statement by an appraiser concerning the estimated value of a property. The report must include:</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<ul>
<li>A breakdown of how the square footage was calculated</li>

<h2><strong>How to Determine Your Property&#8217;s Value and Why It Matters</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/How-to-Determine-Your-Propertys-Value-and-Why-It-Matters-1024x576.jpg" alt="How to Determine Your Property's Value and Why It Matters" class="wp-image-4560" srcset="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/How-to-Determine-Your-Propertys-Value-and-Why-It-Matters-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/How-to-Determine-Your-Propertys-Value-and-Why-It-Matters-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/How-to-Determine-Your-Propertys-Value-and-Why-It-Matters-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/How-to-Determine-Your-Propertys-Value-and-Why-It-Matters.jpg 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When you know your home&#8217;s value, you can determine whether a listing is priced appropriately and provide an overview of your overall financial health.</p>



<p>Here are two ways to determine your property&#8217;s value in Malaysia:</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>1. Consult a property valuer</strong></h4>



<p>A property valuer gives professional advice to those who buy, sell, and rent land and property. They provide their clients with an estimate of their land&#8217;s and buildings&#8217; market value.</p>



<p>With the information collected, property owners can maximise their profit from a sale or rental agreement or refinance their property to reduce their mortgage rates.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>2. Meet with a real estate agent </strong></h4>



<p>You can also ask a local real estate agent for a comparative market analysis.</p>



<p>Though it is not as detailed as a professional appraisal from a property valuer, it provides an evaluation of the home and market to come up with an estimate of the property&#8217;s value.</p>

<p>If you are buying a house, renting an apartment or applying for a bank loan, you would probably realise that they all require you to submit an <strong>income document</strong>. But what exactly are income documents?</p>



<p>Income documents are necessary for banks, financial institutions, landlords, and many other entities. The amount you earn can determine many things, from your insurance plan to the amount you receive for a <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/personal-loan-malaysia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal loan</a> or <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/loan-rejected-services/mortgage-loan-rejected-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mortgage loan</a>.</p>



<p>However, deciding what counts as an income document can be confusing. In this article, we’ll discuss what income documents can serve as <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/income-proof-malaysia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proof of income</a> for different types of employment.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>What Is An Income Document?</strong></h2>



<p>An income document is a form of documentation which verifies an individual’s income and employment status.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Why Do You Need An Income Document?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="970" height="546" src="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Why-Do-You-Need-An-Income-Document.jpg" alt="Why Do You Need An Income Document" class="wp-image-4565" srcset="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Why-Do-You-Need-An-Income-Document.jpg 970w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Why-Do-You-Need-An-Income-Document-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Why-Do-You-Need-An-Income-Document-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></figure>



<p>If you have rented an apartment or applied for a loan before, you’ll know that these are some situations when it’s necessary to demonstrate your proof of income.</p>



<p>Another situation where you would need to provide your income document is when you are buying a house. You would need to show your proof of income to get pre-qualified or pre-approved for a bank loan.</p>



<p>This is advantageous for you as getting pre-approved for a loan increases your negotiating power to get the best interest rate possible. Income documents are also helpful to show that you have a steady income and can make monthly bank instalments on time.</p>



<p>Lenders, such as banks and financial institutions, have different criteria in terms of <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/ccris-report-credit-score/">credit scores</a>, down payments, and <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/dsr-calculator-malaysia/">debt-to-income ratios</a>. However, one similarity they share is that you must prepare your income documents to serve as proof.</p>

<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>Types of Income and their Income Documents</strong></h2>



<p>Different types of employment have different wages and income documents. Understanding the different types of income is beneficial to ensure that you submit the right documents during any application process.</p>



<p>The 2 most common income types are:</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>1. <strong>Stable Income</strong></h4>



<p>A stable job is often a position with a consistent schedule and income and is a role that employees can hold for a long time.</p>



<p>For example, an individual can work for the same company or maintain a career in a stable field for many years.</p>



<p>Income documents from your employer can give the most up-to-date picture of your income since they include any changes in your wages from the past year. Examples of income documents include:</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<ul>
<li>Payslips</li>



<li>EPF statement</li>



<li>Bank statement</li>



<li>Income tax forms</li>



<li>Tax receipt &nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>2. <strong>Fluctuating Income</strong></h4>



<p>Fluctuating income refers to income that varies because of intermittent income, bonuses, commissions, overtime or other seasonal employment. Business entities and jobs that fall under this category include:</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<ul>
<li>Private limited companies (Sdn Bhd)</li>



<li>Sole-proprietorship</li>



<li>Part-time jobs (not all salaries can be considered for proof of income)</li>



<li>Full commission earner</li>



<li>Basic and commission earner &nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>If you are an independent contractor and freelancer, your income documents are different from those with a stable income. Examples of income documents for people with fluctuating income include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Employment verification letter</li>



<li>Bank statements</li>



<li><a href="https://www.hasil.gov.my/en/forms/download-forms/">Income tax forms</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Can You Refinance Without Income Verification?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Can-You-Refinance-Without-Income-Verification-1024x576.jpg" alt="Can You Refinance Without Income Verification" class="wp-image-4566" srcset="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Can-You-Refinance-Without-Income-Verification-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Can-You-Refinance-Without-Income-Verification-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Can-You-Refinance-Without-Income-Verification-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Can-You-Refinance-Without-Income-Verification-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Can-You-Refinance-Without-Income-Verification.jpg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If you want to apply for a refinancing loan, you must provide proof of income. This is because your lender will look at the income documents you’ve provided to verify that you have a stable income to make your mortgage payments.</p>



<p>However, if you&#8217;re self-employed or rely on commissions, there are other ways you can obtain funds to refinance your home.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>1. <strong>Get A No Documentation Loan</strong></h4>



<p>A no documentation loan is a home loan that doesn&#8217;t require standard income documents for approval. It is often granted to individuals who do not have a regular source of income, including those who are self-employed.</p>



<p>The lender allows the borrower to use other documents, such as bank statements, to show that they can repay a mortgage.</p>



<p>Below are four common requirements for no documentation loan:</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<ul>
<li><strong>Have Good Credit</strong>
<ul>
<li>No documentation loan programmes generally require a higher credit score than a regular loan with income documents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<ul>
<li><strong>Make A Large Down Payment</strong>
<ul>
<li>The minimum down payment on no documentation loans usually starts at 20%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Interest Rates</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lenders will charge higher interest rates compared to a regular mortgage as you will not be providing documentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<ul>
<li><strong>Prove You Can Repay The Loan</strong>
<ul>
<li>Whether it&#8217;s bank deposit statements, the income you receive from renting out your properties or a large stockpile of assets, lenders need proof you have the resources to make monthly payments on your loan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>2. <strong>Look For A Co-Signer</strong></h4>



<p>Unfortunately, not everyone has a financial record that is good enough to obtain a refinancing loan.</p>



<p>However, these people can seek a co-signer for help. It could be a family member, friend or someone the applicant knows who is willing to be liable if the applicant is unable to pay the rent.</p>



<p>The process for applying for a loan with a co-signer is similar to when you apply for one yourself. The only difference is that the lender will also assess the co-signer’s financial health and records before granting the loan.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>3. <strong>Ask to Restructure Your Loan</strong></h4>



<p>For financially stressed individuals, <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/loan-restructuring-company-malaysia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loan restructuring</a> can be helpful. It is used by businesses and individuals to prevent defaulting on their current debts by negotiating reduced interest rates.</p>



<p>Plus, loan restructuring benefits both the creditor and the debtor. The debtor will be able to avoid bankruptcy, while the creditor will receive more than they would have compared to their debtor going bankrupt.</p>



<p>However, take note that once the adjustment is made, your CCRIS will have a &#8216;C&#8217; or &#8216;T&#8217; remark and would potentially affect your future loan applications.</p>

<h2><strong>Income Documents &#8211; FAQs</strong></h2>

<p>To make your loan application process easier for you, we have compiled 3 popular questions about income and income documents in Malaysia.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1670944222134"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Can a bank statement serve as an income document?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Third-party evidence is the most reliable way to prove your income. Your bank statements record all of your incoming deposits, including payroll deposits and the checks and debits coming out of your account.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1670944243415"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What happens if I do not report self-employment income?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Not reporting cash income or payments received can lead to hefty fines and penalties; worse, you could end up in jail.

Credit card issuers must consider your ability to repay your <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/credit-card-debt-malaysia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit card debt</a> before extending a new line of credit. Therefore, listing your annual income is a requirement on all credit card applications.</p> </div> </div>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking to save up for the future, <strong>home refinancing in Malaysia</strong> can be a strategic move. However, you need to do it right!</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a quick guide to refinancing your home loan in Malaysia to fully understand how it works.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>What is Home Refinancing</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/What-is-Home-Refinancing-1024x576.jpg" alt="What is Home Refinancing" class="wp-image-4576" srcset="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/What-is-Home-Refinancing-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/What-is-Home-Refinancing-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/What-is-Home-Refinancing-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/What-is-Home-Refinancing-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bluebricks.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/What-is-Home-Refinancing-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Home refinancing in Malaysia involves borrowing money from a bank under a new loan to settle the debt you owe in your current home loan account. It also allows you to pay lesser interest on your property and free up cash.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of how it works. Let&#8217;s say your home&#8217;s original value is RM500,000, and the amount you currently owe on your home loan is RM400,000.</p>



<p>After consulting a property valuer, your home is valued to be RM600,000. If you refinance your home for 80% of its current value, you will receive RM80,000 to use for other purposes, such as <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/saving-for-retirement-malaysia/">saving up for your retirement</a>.</p>



<p>Your home is an investment, and refinancing is one way you can use your home to leverage that investment. There are many reasons for home refinancing in Malaysia, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>To obtain a lower interest rate</li>



<li>To shorten the term of your current mortgage</li>



<li>To raise funds to deal with a financial emergency, finance a large purchase, or consolidate debt</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Refinancing is a strategic move. Therefore, many elements come into play when determining whether you maximise the benefits.</p>



<p>If you plan on refinancing your property, we’ve prepared a step-by-step guide on home refinancing in Malaysia for you.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>1. <strong>Value Your Property</strong></h4>



<p>The first step to home refinancing in Malaysia is to value your property. Choose your preferred property valuer and prepare the necessary documents, such as the Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA), before they commence the property inspection.</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve passed the documents, the property valuers will physically visit and inspect your property.</p>



<p>After that, they will work with a bank to prepare the property valuation report. You will have to pay the balance amount in order to receive the report.</p>



<p>To get the most out of your property, it is recommended that you consult a panel of various property valuers to know the average to the highest value of your property.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<ul type="i">
<li><strong>Loan Agency &amp; Property Valuation</strong>
<ul>
<li>A key fact that homeowners should know when obtaining a property valuation report is that they are required to pay a valuation fee. It is typically 0.3% of the property&#8217;s market value.</li>



<li>However, homeowners can also evaluate their property with a loan agency like Bluebricks. We first obtain the necessary information from our clients, such as their name and address, along with their desired house and land size and type.</li>



<li>We will then contact the valuation firm designated by the bank (the bank will arrange which value firm to use according to the customer&#8217;s surname) on behalf of our client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>2. <strong>Check Your CCRIS Statement</strong></h4>



<p>A <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/ccris-report-credit-score/">Central Credit Reference Information System (CCRIS) statement</a> is essential in getting your home refinancing loan approved in Malaysia.</p>



<p>You can obtain your CCRIS report from credit reporting agencies registered by the Ministry of Finance under the Credit Reporting Agencies Act 2010. Examples include CTOS, Credit Bureau Malaysia and Experian.</p>



<p>Financial institutions use the report to assess if you are capable of returning the money you have borrowed from them. It includes your credit card debts, house loans, car loans, personal loans, and more.</p>



<p>Different banks and financial institutions assess loan applications differently. However, they tend to look negatively at a credit card or bank loan at its maximum limit, as it shows poor financial management.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the result of a loan application depends on the individual assessment criteria used by the bank you are applying from. If the outcome is positive, your loan will be approved.</p>



<p>However, it’s worth noting that being rejected from a loan application will be recorded on any further CCRIS reports requested in the next 12 months.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>3. <strong>Loan Application Essentials </strong></h4>



<p>If you&#8217;re a fixed-income earner, applying for a house refinancing loan in Malaysia is relatively easier than someone self-employed or freelancing. You would need to prepare:</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<ul>
<li>Your payslips</li>



<li>Your EPF statements</li>



<li>Your bank statements</li>



<li>A copy of your MyKad</li>



<li>Your proof of funds</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>If you&#8217;re a self-employed business owner, whether of an enterprise or a private limited company (Sdn Bhd), you would have to prepare the following documents:</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<ul>
<li>A copy of your MyKad</li>



<li>The latest 6 months of your company bank statement</li>



<li>The latest 2 years of income tax with payment receipt</li>



<li>The latest 2 years of your audit reports</li>



<li>Your latest management accounts</li>



<li>A copy of your property&#8217;s SNP agreement (the first and last 5 pages)</li>



<li>A copy of your land title (Geran)</li>



<li>Your tax assessment (Cukai Taksiran)</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The only document that is different would be the SSM document. Enterprise owners would need to prepare their latest SSM document, whereas a private limited company owner would need to prepare their latest SSM Form 9, 24 and 49.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>4. <strong>Submit Your Documents To The Bank</strong></h4>



<p>On average, financial institutions take about one to two weeks to approve your loan application, and it only begins when you supply all the documents required.</p>



<p>However, if the bank is concerned about your ability to repay, they may request additional documents from you. This will further delay your home loan approval process. &nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>5. <strong>Wait For Your Loan Application Results</strong></h4>



<p>Unfortunately, if your loan application is rejected, you will have to wait for another 3 to 6 months before submitting another application. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>6. <strong>Sign The Letter Of Offer If The Application Is Approved</strong></h4>



<p>Before signing the Letter Of Offer from the bank, thoroughly read through it to ensure your personal details and the approved loan amount are correct.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>7. <strong>Sign The Loan Agreement With A Panel Loan Lawyer</strong></h4>



<p>Every institution, whether it is financial, regulatory, policy-making or educational, needs a lawyer.</p>



<p>A panel lawyer of a banking or financial institution must be well versed in banking and commercial laws. These in-house lawyers are expected to provide legal advice and are responsible for instructing and managing external legal counsel. &nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>8. <strong>Wait For The Loan Drawdown</strong></h4>



<p>A loan drawdown is when funds are released under an agreement with a lender. It means you are using the money the lender provided to buy your desired property. &nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>9. <strong>Collect Your Loan Amount</strong></h4>



<p>Once the loan application process is finalised, you can either visit a lawyer to collect the cheque or directly transfer the amount to your bank account.</p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<h2><strong>Home Refinancing in Malaysia &#8211; FAQs</strong></h2>



<p>If you want to know more before carrying on with the refinancing process, below are some popular questions to help you better understand home refinancing in Malaysia.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1670948598302"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>When should I refinance my home?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The best time to refinance a home is different according to the person. Your individual circumstances, financial situation, and current mortgage rates should inform your decision.<br/>But ultimately, refinancing is worthwhile if it helps you save you money. For example, if you have an <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/medical-fees-debt-refinance/">emergency cost</a> to cover, you can apply for a <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/cash-out-refinancing-advantages/">cash-out refinance</a> to tap into your property&#8217;s equity to cover your emergency cost.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1670948645816"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Is it worth it to refinance my home?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Refinancing isn&#8217;t a simple decision. You should be aware of the pros and cons of refinancing before committing to it. One advantage of refinancing is that you will have a shorter loan term. This means you pay off your loan quicker, build up equity faster, and spend less on interest over time.<br/>However, these savings may not be worth it if they are minimal. On top of that, your monthly payment has a chance of increasing if you shorten the repayment period. Because of these potential disadvantages, it&#8217;s important to decide when you want to refinance your loan carefully.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1670948687305"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Do I lose my home equity when I refinance?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Your <a href="https://www.bluebricks.com.my/home-equity-personal-loan/">home equity</a> remains intact when you refinance your home with a new loan. However, you should be cautious of fluctuating home equity value. Several factors impact your home equity, for example, unemployment levels, interest rates, crime rates and more.</p> </div> </div>
